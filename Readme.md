This project provides a solutions manual for all excercises in the Ziheng Yang's two seminal books on statistical molecular evolution: [<i>Computational Molecular Evolution</i>](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/CME/) (CME2006) [Yang 2006] and [<i>Molecular Evolution: A Statistical Approach</i>](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/MESA/) (MESA2014) [Yang 2014].

Authors: **Sishuo Wang**, **Jianhao Lv**. Interestingly, Ziheng Yang and both of the authors are alumni of China Agricultural University.
* [Sishuo Wang](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/med/mic/People/Sishuo.html) is a research assistant professor in Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.
* [Jianhao Lv](https://sxy.nfu.edu.cn/xygk/szdw/szql/zj/c9cea5751f3c448585440f7b5b4a46bc.htm ) is a lecturer at Nanfang College, Guangzhou, China.

We hope the solutions manual plays a tiny role in helping people better understand Ziheng's books and appreciate molecular phylogenetics from a statistics perspective.

**You are strongly encouraged to share your feedback and explore alternative solutions via this GitHub platform**. Your contributions can help foster a community-driven effort to assist anyone interested in delving deeper into molecular evolution.

# Notes
1. The solutions manual has NOT been reviewed, so by no means are the solutions to be taken as a “standard answer”. Instead, we aim to help biologists better understand computational molecular evolution by providing
   * very detailed step-by-step solutions
   * code as R as possible (as that's familiar to most biologists), from **programming** to **calculus, linear algebra and statistical computation**
   * alternative solutions where possible.

2. The problems cover only a small part of the books so it is highly recommended to carefully read the original book for those interested.

3. Ziheng provided very insightful solututions to four problems of Yang 2006 [https://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/CME/Yang2006CME.Exercises.pdf](https://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/CME/Yang2006CME.Exercises.pdf). For these problems, we try to provide different solutions where possible, as also indicated above.
  
4. The solutions manual is provided in both pdf format and markdown-based view. Note that there might be errors in format conversion for the markdown file (.md) due to unexpected format conversion errors.
